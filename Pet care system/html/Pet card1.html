               <div class="tt">MY STORY</div>
               <div class="pr">NIKKI is a sweet, adorable German Shepherd female. She is about 3-4 months old and right now weighs 2 pounds - a bit on the heavy side for her (her ideal weight should be around 75 pounds). This wonderful dog spent 2 months in a shelter, and we rescued her on December 31st 2021 - the day she was scheduled to be euthanized.
                NIKKI is a happy, confident, well-balanced girl who loves life and people.<br><br> She gets attached to her person very quickly and follows them everywhere, wanting to be right next to them - pretty much a “velcro” dog. She has been living in a foster home with small- and large-size dogs and does well with all of them. She is a calm girl herself and prefers to be around calm dogs.
                 She is good with dogs but hasn't shown any interest in playing with them yet - she is one of those dogs more into her people than other pets. Tessa has no problem being alone if the owner needs to go out -
                 she is not destructive, doesn't bark, is good alone in the yard, doesn't try to escape, doesn't dig, and doesn't try to jump a fence.
                
                NIKKI walks well on leash - she doesn’t pull, and with some basic training she will be a perfect dog. She is also mannerly during her outings, so if other dogs walk by she doesn’t bark at them and just looks at them curiously. She is always happy to see people and might jump on them to say “Hi” in a friendly way. Tessa definitely loves car rides: for the first few minutes she’ll be very excited, move around, try to come to the front seat, but then lies down and remains calm.
                She did great at the groomer’s and loves to get pampered. <br><br>She also did great during her vet exam, and kept giving kisses to the doctor. NIKKI loves toys and is very gentle with them, as if careful to not destroy them. She especially likes balls and playing fetch: she picks up the ball, brings it back, and drops it. Tessa enjoys going for daily walks and even hikes, if the owner is pretty active. She is housebroken and if she has to potty she will whine a little, to let you know that she needs to go outside.
                
                Tessa is an absolutely wonderful dog and someone will be very fortunate to have her in their life. She is located in Colombo 12.</div>
